        <p>My name is Antar Martin, and I am learning coding fore the first time in my life. This has been a very interesting experience up to this point. Being someone who has been primarily a musician for most of his life, web development has been quite the undertaking. I’ve been playing bass for 23 years now, and I’ve decided to go into the world of web development. After finding myself in a string a disappointing jobs, I’ve decided that it’s time for a career change. A lot of people that I know, musicians Included, have made the switch over to web development. It seems like a very fun and rewarding job that can go with you anywhere you go. I’ve also been wanting a career that gives me more flexibility, time to spend with family friends, that gives me time to travel as well as making time for music. This is just a paragraph that’s here for the purpose of creating content.  </p>
